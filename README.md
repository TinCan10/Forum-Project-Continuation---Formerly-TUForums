# TUForums
This is the repository for TUForums

To start run the index.js in the tuforums/api folder and then enter tuforums and run npm start.

Libraries used in addition to the MERN libraries:

React-Router-Dom: This was used to add routes to our website to load different pages in react.

Body-Parser: A library used to help parse requests for express.
Hosting: Vercel was used to host the website, and MongoDB Atlas was used to host the database.

Bootstrap: Was used early on for a sidebar, but we already had enough trouble with css so we removed it when converting to react.

WebStorage API: Allows us to demonstrate what a website using a database would look like without yet implementing an actual database by storing data locally to the machine and by session.

Dotenv: Used to create env files, mainly used to help with hosting the website.
